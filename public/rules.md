Profanus is a raiding guild on Ragnaros EU. Our purpose is to have good
progression, while only raiding twice a week. In order to facilitate this, we
have some guidelines and rules that apply to our raiders without exception.

As a raiding guild, our primary goal is to kill as many bosses as possible per
raid. We have outlined how we achieve this below. Every Profanus raider is
expected to know and to follow these rules.

## 1. Time inside raids

Our most important rule is not to waste time in raids. When properly followed,
it ensures we can make the most of our raids. Below are some examples of how
this rule applies in a concrete way, but the main takeaway is to be mindful of
our time and not to waste it.

### 1.1. Come prepared

You have enough food, flasks, and potions on you to make it through the raid.
You are at the raid entrance 15 minutes before the raid. You have read up on
the tactics of new bosses we will be progressing on. You know how to play your
class and spec.

No time will be wasted on getting potions or flasks from the AH, waiting for
people to log on, or explaining tactics.

### 1.2. Be available

You do not AFK on trash or before a boss. You do not Alt+Tab when you die. You
stay in the game, listening for calls and paying attention to the fight. For the
three hours you're raiding, your attention is on the raid.

We will have a break in the middle of the raid where raiders can take care of
whatever business. Outside of that, no time will be wasted on waiting for
people.

### 1.3. Be serious

You don't pull extra trash packs we don't need to kill. You don't fail
on the same tactic many times. You don't put your own DPS above killing the
boss. You listen to the raid leader and the officers. You don't try to kill
other raiders for 'fun'.

## 2. Attendance

You should have at least 80% attendance. This means you can miss one in five
raids. Since we only raid twice a week, it should be possible for everyone to meet
this schedule. If you can't, you cannot be a raider with us.

If you cannot make a raid day, let the officers know well in advance. At
minimum, you should be able to tell them the day before the raid. If you often
cancel right before the raid, we will try to replace you to ensure our regular
raiding schedule.

## 3. Time outside of raids

Profanus tries to facilitate people with little time to play. That said, you
need to log in outside of raids in order to progress in World of Warcraft. We
don't have specific guidelines for how often this should be, but if you fall
too far behind in terms of progressing your character, it may be hard to
maintain your raid spot. We will not enforce a schedule outside of the raids,
but we will organize guild events to help progress our characters together.

## 4. Loot

We have a loot council consisting of the officers and raid leader to distribute
loot. They will attempt to distribute loot to increase the *overall* performance
of the raid. This means you might not always get the loot you want.

There will be loot penalties for failing to follow the rules outlined above.
However, the rules exist because they will make the raids more fun and
productive. Intentionally ignoring the rules because you don't need loot is
obviously not funny or smart.

When asked, the officers will provide a reason for the way they distribute
loot. The goal is to be fair and sensible.

"We are all educated people here" and we do not want to babysit one another.
Therefore we have full trust that our decisions will be made taking the team
into consideration, we will all have raid food in our bags at all times, we
will not squabble over loot and in case we screw up, we will be ready to deal
with the consequences. Happy raiding!
