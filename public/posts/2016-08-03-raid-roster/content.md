As you all know, we have recently done a survey on what class, spec and role you all
want to raid with in the upcoming expansion. We have discussed and processed the
results and we want to share the results with you today.

Be aware that everything in this post is subject to change. We will do our best
to keep you in the loop, but you may not always have the most recent information.
We encourage you to talk to us if you have questions.

Below is an overview of the classes and roles people want to play:

|   | Tank | Healer | Melee DPS | Ranged DPS |
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| Death Knight | 1 |   | 1 |   | 
| Demon Hunter | 0 |   | 1 |   |
| Druid        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Hunter       |   |   | 0 | 1 |
| Mage         |   |   |   | 1 |
| Monk         | 0 | 2 | 0 |   |
| Paladin      | 1 | 1.5* | 1.5* |   |
| Priest       |   | 1 |   | 1 |
| Rogue        |   |   | **4** |   |
| Shaman       |   | 1 | **3** | 1 |
| Warlock      |   |   |   | 1 |
| Warrior      | 0.5* |   | 0.5* |   |
| **_Total_**    | **_3.5_** | **_6.5_** | **_11_** | **_5_** |

_* One player will play two roles with this class._

From this table we can conclude a few things:

1. We have reasonable spread over the classes
2. That said; we have too many melee DPS, specifically rogues and enhancement shamans
3. We don't have anywhere near enough ranged DPS

We will be recruiting some new ranged DPS over the coming weeks,
before legion launches. Those of you who have entered a melee DPS spec,
specifically a rogue or enhancement shaman, keep in mind that we cannot
take you all into the same raid. You will likely end up spending some time
on the bench.

If you have changed your mind based on these numbers, please notify one of us on
Slack or in game. We will keep an up-to-date spreadsheet with everyone's choices,
and we'll keep updating the website when significant changes have occured. Keep in
mind that if you're the only person in your role/class cell, it might be better
not to change. For example, if our only DK DPS now wanted to play a caster, we'd have to recruit a
new Death Knight, even though we have enough melee DPS overall.

We hope that this information is useful to you and we're excited to raid with you in Legion!
