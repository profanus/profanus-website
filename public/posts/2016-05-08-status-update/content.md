We felt it was time to provide a quick status update on some of the things officers
have discussed and done recently. Our goal is always to keep you in the loop and to
involve you in guild matters as much as possible.

This status update will detail our plans to manage our roster and our stance on bringing 
alts to the guild raids.

### Our roster

The officers have been busy recruiting, and you should see some new faces showing
up to the guild raids in the coming weeks. We are aiming for a roster of ~25 people,
and have opened recruitment to all classes and roles, except for healers (for now).
If you have friends that could be a good match for us, don't hesitate to let us
know.

We have also noticed that attendance has been less than stellar. In order to have
a stable team, we will take a closer look at your attendance over the coming weeks
and take appropriate action when it's not enough to warrant the raider rank. Please
make sure to *sign up* or *decline* the raid events in the calendar to assist us in
this process.

We are optimistic that we can meet our roster requirements, and we think we can
commit fully to mythic progression in the coming weeks.

### Bringing alts to guild raids

Multiple people have expressed a wish to bring alts to the guild raids.
Although we are not against this, we want to establish some guidelines for
what is acceptable and what is not. Starting tomorrow (Monday may 9), the
following rules will apply:

1. For mythic raids, you cannot bring alts unless we ask you to;

2. For upper HFC, you can bring alts, provided they have an item level of at least *710* and your main at least *720*;

3. For lower HFC, you can bring alts, provided they have an item level of at least *705* and your main at least *715*;

4. If we ask you to log your main, you must do so;

5. Alts will have lowest priority from the loot council.

Alts are nice way to keep raid content fun, but they should not get in the way of our progress into mythic.
We think these rules will enable both.

As always, don't hestitate to ask us questions about any of the above.

Thank you,

Your officers
