This Tuesday (12-04), your guild officers had a meeting. In order to keep you informed,
we will post meeting notes from such meetings to the guild website going forward. Here
is the first set of notes.

### Loot and progress

* We will do *one more* lockout where we do heroic HFC from the start. Starting from the
  next lockout after that (April 20), we will only do Heroic from the Upper Spire onwards (skipping
  the earlier bosses, hopefully to have more time for progress).

* We will use [RCLootCouncil](http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil) for our loot 
  council decisions. We require everyone to install it in order to make the loot council 
  smooth and fast. Please do so at the latest before the next raid.
  
* If you win loot, you should hold on to it. If you don't want an item, don't roll. We have
  seen some people trade loot after the fact and while this seems like a nice thing to do, it 
  bybasses our loot system and it doesn't help the guild. If you really do not want an item
  you got, please ask us to put it up for a roll again.
  
* When we go mythic, we will start using the loot council system for all loot, not just trinkets,
  weapons and tier.

### Recruitment for Mythic

We have taken a look at [our roster](http://guildaudit.com/g/14493) and we know we need to start
recruiting. As it stands, we've made the following decisions.

* Wakrash will switch to his DK

* Ode (Rót) will switch to a druid (balance)

* We need to recruit at least a mage, probably another mage and boomkin

Note that Jäbi has already started on this effort, and Oomii will be posting to the forums
and other places soon in order to get the team ready ASAP.

### Guild bank & money management

* We want to encourage people to bring their own food to raids, rather than using
  banquets. Individual food gives more stats and it takes some of the load off of
  the guild bank.

* We will organize events in which we will all try to collect materials for the guild
  bank. There will be prizes of some sort to reward the biggest contributors.
  
* We will also be handing out a small weekly prize to whoever contributed most to
  the guild bank that week.
  
We hope these points make sense, but feel to ask questions in Slack or in game.

*Oomii, Wakrash, Muhveli & Waesane*
