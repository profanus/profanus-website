As you all know, we have decided to merge the two guilds 'The Royal' and 'New
Horde Order'. Earlier today, we discussed how this merge is going to work and
made some decisions about the organization. In short, we decided on the
following points.

First of all, we will *not* be joining either The Royal or New Horde Order.
Instead, we will merge under the name Profanus. Profanus is an old guild, with
a lot of history (and guild achievements). However, we will not be 'reviving'
it, instead this will be a clean slate.

Secondly, Oomii will be our new guild leader. Wakrash and Muhveli will be
officers.  Awesan (Waesane) will be the raid leader, and Nightranger (and soon
JÃ¤bi) will be spearheading our recruitment efforts. We feel that this team will
provide a strong foundation for the guild.

Thirdly, we have decided we will be raiding *two* days per lockout, and will
vote on exactly what days those will be. We will also be organizing a third
'fun night' on Fridays. This will not be mandatory, but everyone is invited.
We'll be doing normal mode, mount farms, dungeons, pvp, etc. and probably get
drunk.

Fourth, we have decided to distribute loot in the following way. Tier, weapons
and trinkets will be divided by a loot council consisting of Oomii, Muhveli,
Awesan and Wakrash. All other gear will be decided via a loot roll. The loot
council will prioritize getting everyone their set bonuses and will give loot
to people who need it most. Obviously we will prioritize members over trials.

Fifthly, recruitment will work in the following way. We will ask *all* potential
recruits to fill out our recruitment form. If we feel that a recruit looks capable,
we will invite them. After they have raided with us for at least one full lockout,
we will evaluate them on performance, attitude, attendance, etc. and make a decision.
If recruits misbehave before they have been with us for a full lockout, we will not
hesitate to remove them.

We hope these make sense to you, but feel free to ask questions. We're looking
forward to building a great raiding guild with you!

Oomii, Wakrash, Awesan, Muhveli & Nightranger
