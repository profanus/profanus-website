Here we are at the edge of another cliff.

This year, we took a lot of chances. We took a risk on the 
merge, we gambled on a lot of new people, we knew the summer 
break was a long shot. We came out alive and kicking. We even 
emerged out of a guild meet without any blood spilled.

At times we were salty and at times bitter, but we have achieved 
the humble goals we set at the start. And in Legion we are aiming higher.

I have said many times that we got lucky, but it was the 
character, the trust and the perseverance of our people 
that made this guild a community. It takes a while to
build something out of a roster and a few achievement points, 
but we continued to help one another, tolerate the silly jokes
and welcome every new member without reservation. And for this, 
we can be proud.

I am glad to have you as my guildies, I am proud to have you 
as my team-mates and I am grateful to be able to call you my friends.

Thank you.

We have done well.

Your faithful dictator,  
Oomii.
