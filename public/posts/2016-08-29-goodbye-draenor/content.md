Here we are at the edge of another cliff. 

This year, we took a lot of chances. 
We took a risk on the merge, we gambled 
on a lot of new people, we knew the summer 
break was a long shot. We came out alive and kicking. 

At times we were salty and at times bitter, 
but we have achieved the humble goals we set 
at the start. And in Legion we are aiming higher.

I have said many times that we got lucky, 
but it was the character, the trust and the 
perseverance of our people that made this 
guild a community. It takes a while to build 
something out of a roster and a few achievement 
points, but we continued to help one another, 
tolerate the silly jokes and welcome every 
new member without reservation. And for this, 
we can be proud.

I am glad to have you as my guildies, 
I am proud to have you as my team-mates 
and I am grateful to be able to call you my friends.

Thank you.
We have done well.
