Please everyone vote for our raid days going forward. The officers will
decide on two days based on the responses here:

[VOTE!!!](http://goo.gl/forms/tqi7K30tO7)

We will decide on appropriate raid days based on the first and second preferences,
and on availability. You can assume that we will raid 20:00-23:00 server time on
any of the raid days. Note that if you vote the same day twice in the first two
questions, you are trolling yourself only.
