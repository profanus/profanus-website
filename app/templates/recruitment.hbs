      Welcome to the Profanus recruitment page. Before you apply, make sure to read our
      {{#link-to 'info'}}guild info{{/link-to}}.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for active, but casual players. If you are looking for a hardcore
      experience, this guild is not for you. We also like social players; we like to
      talk to people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that we are an English speaking guild and applications filled out in
      languages other than English will result in an instant decline.

      {{officer-link 'Awesan' 'Waesane'}}, {{officer-link 'Wakrash' 'Wakramash'}} or {{officer-link 'Muhveli'}} in game.
